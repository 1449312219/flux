# How to make a release of flux

This process will create a new tagged release of flux, push dockerfiles and upload the `fluxctl` binary to GitHub releases.

## Requirements
- Circle CI must have a secret environmental variable called `GITHUB_TOKEN` which is a personal access token.

## Release process

1. Alter and commit the /CHANGELOG.md file to signify what has changed in this version.
2. Create a new release: https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases/new
4. Fill in the version number for the name and tag. The version number should conform to [semver](semver.org); i.e., look like `1.2.3` (NB: no leading 'v'); optionally with a pre-release suffix, e.g., `1.0.0-beta`
5. Fill in the Description field (possibly a copy paste from the CHANGELOG.md)
6. Click "Publish release"

Circle will then run the build and upload the built binaries to the "Downloads" section of the release.

## Outputs

The most recent binaries are always available at: https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/releases/latest
