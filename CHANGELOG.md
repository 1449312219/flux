## 0.3.0 (2017-05-03)

Update to support newer Kubernetes (1.6.1).

### Potentially breaking changes

- Support for Kubernetes' ReplicationControllers is deprecated; please
  update these to Deployments, which do the same job but much better
  (see
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/replication-controller/#deployment-recommended)
- The service<->daemon protocol is versioned. The daemon will now
  crash-loop, printing a warning to the log, if it tries to connect to
  the service with a deprecated version of the protocol.

### Improvements

-   Updated the version of `kubectl` bundled in the Flux daemon image,
    to work with newer (>1.5) Kubernetes.
-   Added `fluxctl save` command for bootstrapping a repo from an existing cluster
-   You can now record a message and username with each release, which
    show up in notifications

## 0.2.0 (2017-03-16)

More informative and helpful UI.

### Features

-   Lots more documentation
-   More informative output from `fluxctl release`
-   Added option in `fluxctl set-config` to generate a deploy key

### Improvements

-   Slack notifications are tidier
-   Support for releasing to >1 service at a time
-   Better behaviour when flux deploys itself
-   More help given for commonly encountered errors
-   Filter out Kubernetes add-ons from consideration
-   More consistent Prometheus metric labeling
