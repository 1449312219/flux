# Deploying Fluxy to Kubernetes

You will need to build or load the weaveworks/fluxy image into the Docker daemon,
 since the deployment does not attempt to pull the image from a registry.
If you're using [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) to try things locally,
 for example, you can do

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
make clean build
```

which will build the image in minikube's Docker daemon,
 thus making it available to Kubernetes.

The file `fluxy-deployment.yaml` contains a Kubernetes deployment configuration
 that runs the latest image of Fluxy.

```
kubectl create -f fluxy-deployment.yaml
```

To make the pod accessible to `fluxctl`, you can port forward:

```
kubectl port-forward $(kubectl get pods | grep fluxy | awk '{print $1}') 3030:3030
```

This will work with the default settings of `fluxctl`,
 and is especially handy with minikube.

To force Kubernetes to run the latest image, kill the pod:

```
kubectl get pods | grep fluxy | awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs kubectl delete pod
```

## Automation and secrets

The automation component mutates a Git repository, which requires an SSH access key.
That private key is stored as a Kubernetes secret named `fluxy-repo-key`.

```
kubectl delete secret fluxy-repo-key
kubectl create secret generic fluxy-repo-key --from-file=id-rsa=/path/to/id_rsa
```
