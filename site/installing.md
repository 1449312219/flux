menu_order: 20

We recommend that you [install Flux with Weave
Cloud](/site/installing/cloud.md), our hosted service for accelerating
cloud native development. Using Flux in conjunction with [Weave
Cloud](https://www.weave.works/solution/cloud/) has the following
benefits:

* A comprehensive dashboard, allowing control of Flux without the CLI
  application
* Tight integration with other Weave Cloud services
  ([Scope](https://www.weave.works/solution/troubleshooting-dashboard/)
  and
  [Cortex](https://www.weave.works/solution/prometheus-monitoring/))
* Fully hosted and managed by experts at Weaveworks
* Simpler install and operation
* Enterprise support

Alternatively, you can [install Flux
standalone](/site/installing/standalone.md) and still get all of the
core Flux features described in [how it works](./how-it-works.md).
