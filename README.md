# fluxy

Flux, reimagined.

## Workflows

All workflows start with the assumption that I've got a helloworld service running on my platform,
 and I've pushed a new version of the helloworld image to my image repository,
 which I now want to release.

### Explicit

```
$ # Which services are running on my platform?
$ fluxctl service list
SERVICE     IP         PORTS        IMAGE
helloworld  10.0.0.99  80/TCP→80    quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld:master-a000001
kubernetes  10.0.0.1   443/TCP→443  (no selector, no RC)

$ # Which images are available for the helloworld service?
$ fluxctl service images --service=helloworld
CONTAINER   IMAGE                          CREATED
helloworld  quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld
            |   master-9a16ff945b9e        2016-07-20 13:19:29.801863476 +0000 UTC
            |   master-b31c617a0fe3        2016-07-20 13:19:29.801863476 +0000 UTC
            |   master-a000002             2016-07-12 17:17:34.599751439 +0000 UTC
            '-> master-a000001             2016-07-12 17:16:17.770847438 +0000 UTC

$ # Update my resource file to use a new image.
$ fluxctl config update --file helloworld-rc.yaml --image=quay.io/weaveworks/helloworld:master-9a16ff945b9e --output=helloworld-rc.yaml

$ # Release a new version of the helloworld service.
$ fluxctl service release --service=helloworld --file=helloworld-rc.yaml
Starting release of helloworld with an update period of 5s... success

### Interactive

Note: not yet implemented.

```
$ # I'd like to release the latest version of helloworld.
$ fluxctl service release --service=helloworld --interactive

```

### Automated

```
$ # TBD
```

## Installing

If you have a working Go toolchain, you can install the most recent version of the binaries via

```
$ go get github.com/weaveworks/fluxy/cmd/fluxd
$ go get github.com/weaveworks/fluxy/cmd/fluxctl
```

Otherwise, see [the releases page](https://github.com/weaveworks/fluxy/releases) for downloads.

## Developing

### Build

Ensure the repository is checked out into $GOPATH/src/github.com/weaveworks/fluxy.
Then, from the root,

```
$ go install ./...
```

Flux vendors all of its dependencies, so that should be sufficient.
Binaries are installed to $GOPATH/bin.

### Test

```
$ go test ./...
```

### Dependency management

We use [Glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) to manage vendored dependencies.
Note that **we do not check in the vendor folder**.
If you add or remove dependencies, use the following command to update the glide.yaml and glide.lock files,
 and to populate your local vendor folder.

```
$ glide update
```

### Contribution

Flux follows a typical PR workflow.
All contributions should be made as PRs that satisfy the guidelines below.

### Guidelines

- All code must abide [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Names should abide [What's in a name](https://talks.golang.org/2014/names.slide#1)
- Code must build on both Linux and Darwin, via plain `go build`
- Code should have appropriate test coverage, invoked via plain `go test`

In addition, several mechanical checks are enforced.
See [the lint script](/lint) for details.
